    <li>
    <h3>Spatial Analysis-Enhanced Dermatological Image Classification for Paronychia</h3>
    <p>Machine Learning & Computer Vision Project Nov 2023</p>
    <p>Designed a deep learning pipeline combining U-Net segmentation, spatial analysis, and CNN architectures(ResNet34, VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, EfficientNet) to classify dermatological images from the Dermnet dataset.</p>
    <p> Improved classification accuracy up to 97.1% (InceptionV3) by integrating spatial analysis-driven confidence scores; results published in IEEE Xplore (DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.10395209).</p>
    </li>

    <li>
    <h3 class="heading">Restaurant and Food Services Management System</h3>
    <p>Web/Database Development Project May 2025</p>
    <p>Designed and developed a web-based platform for food ordering, reservations, and inventory tracking,enabling seamless interaction between customers and restaurant admins.</p>
    <p>Implemented MySQL database with ERD, relational constraints, and PHP-MySQL integration, ensuring dataintegrity while streamlining restaurant workflows and service management.</p>
